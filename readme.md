**README**

This is a test generator. It is a JavaFX application and it will be a simple exercise.

The application will allow the user to create a test (like, a school exam) and use the interactive UI instead of formatting a test themselves.

It will utilize a database (which one TBD) to store the test data. Export format for the formatted test output file may be .docx or .rtf, depending on technical limitations.
